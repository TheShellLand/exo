nmap --script "http-*"

    Loads all scripts whose name starts with http-, such as http-auth and http-open-proxy. The argument to --script had to be in quotes to protect the wildcard from the shell.

More complicated script selection can be done using the and, or, and not operators to build Boolean expressions. The operators have the same precedence as in Lua: not is the highest, followed by and and then or. You can alter precedence by using parentheses. Because expressions contain space characters it is necessary to quote them.

nmap --script "not intrusive"
    Loads every script except for those in the intrusive category.

nmap --script "default or safe"
    This is functionally equivalent to nmap --script "default,safe". It loads all scripts that are in the default category or the safe category or both.

nmap --script "default and safe"
    Loads those scripts that are in both the default and safe categories.

nmap --script "(default or safe or intrusive) and not http-*"
    Loads scripts in the default, safe, or intrusive categories, except for those whose names start with http-.
